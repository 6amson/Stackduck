# üê£ StackDuck

A fast, lightweight distributed task queue system built in **Rust** using **gRPC**, **Redis**, and **PostgreSQL**. StackDuck lets you enqueue tasks from any gRPC client (like NestJS) and run background jobs using dynamic, scalable workers.

## üöÄ Features

- ü¶Ä Written in Rust
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Supports gRPC API for enqueueing jobs
- üß† Pluggable worker architecture (Rust or Node/NestJS)
- üíæ PostgreSQL for persistence
- üß∞ Redis or in-memory fallback for job queues
- üõ°Ô∏è Designed for horizontal scalability
